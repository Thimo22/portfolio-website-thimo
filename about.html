      <p class="about-text">
        I’m Thimo van der Vlies, a 23-year-old ICT & Media Design student at the Fontys University of Applied Sciences in Eindhoven. I currently live in Helmond. 
        I love to make designs, and I am beginning to enjoy coding more and more. <br>
        I choose ICT & Media design because I really like doing creative things, it makes me feel happy especially if I can help another person. <br>
        When I busy with my projects I dive in the deep and try to make the best thing I can at that moment... <br><br>
        I currently work part-time at Jumbo in the AGF department, where I’ve developed skills in customer service, teamwork, and time management. <br>
        I love doing my job that's why I work there for already 6 years and counting. <br>
        I’m eager to apply my knowledge in real-world projects and contribute to innovative solutions for ICT. <br><br>
        Last year I got sick with Crohn dissease, after finishing my 2nd year I took a gap year to recover and to find the right medicine. <br>
        Now that I feel good enough, I am motivated to find a internship where I can utilize my skills. <br><br>
        As for now I want to become a UI/UX Designer or maybe a Front-End Developer in the future. <br>
        I have more projects that I have made, but I have chosen the ones that had a special meaning to me, you can find those on the projects page. <br><br>
        If you want to know more about me or you are interested, please contact me, on my contact page contact links.
