          In semester 3 I and my group had to make campaign for Livewall. <br>
          Livewall had a client McDonald's where they make campaigns for their app. <br>
          From there we formed the group Killustrated, and we pretented like we where a real company making something for the client.

        <h2>Brief introduction of the client project</h2>
        <p class="text-explain">
            You are going to work on a campaign for McDonald's. <br>
            A good campaign has an objective and a theme or topic. <br> 
            The general objective has already been established: attract visitors to McDonald's restaurants and increase customer loyalty. <br>
            You can fill in the theme yourself. <br>
            There are a number of directions possible:
            <li>Connecting to an event or holiday, such as Easter, the Euro Cup 2024 or Halloween. </li>
            <li>Promoting a McDonald's product or service, such as the introduction of the new chilly saus or promoting McDonald's children's parties.</li>
            <li>Bringing attention to a value from the McDonald's sustainability program ‘Scale for Good’, for example waste reduction.</li>
        </p>
      </div>
  
      <!-- Goal of project -->
      <div class="project-section">
        <h2>Steps in the project</h2>
        <p class="text-explain">
            We divided the work, I made the survey and researched it. While others did interviews. <br>
            Everyone took a topic to do an secondary reseach about, from there we got a lot of insights. <br>
            Where we did make a low-fidelity prototype and I made sketches of possible merchandise that was not yet made. <br>
            <em>(these sketches just ideas and are not to cause any damage to McDonald's)</em>
        </p>
        <div class="project-img">
            <img src="img/merchandise_mc.png" id="mid-img" alt="merchandise sketch">
          </div>
          <p class="text-explain">
            We got a pitch that we did for our client. <br>
            After our pitch we got some feedback, like the merchandise can not have an altered logo of McDonald's. <br>
            We implemented the feedback and moved further the design phase in. <br>
            We came with the idea to make a game that you want to go to the McDonald's but you get obstacles on your way that you have to avoid on the beach (we named it Summer Rush). <br>
            After some iterations we came to the finalized iteration of the design and went into the coding phase were we splitted the work among us. <br>
            Everyone helped each other with some of their pages to make compleet the code, so that we could test it to some users. <br>
            After some changes we made a final presentation for the client. <br>
            They were happy with the result, but we did not win of all the other groups unfortunately. <br>
