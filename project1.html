          I had to do research to hybrid frameworks. To get an introduction I had to pick a hybrid framework, this is to help me understand what hybrid development means and how it works on a technical level. <br>
          I had to choose out of a list with frameworks and I choose for Ionic.
        </p>
      </div>
  
      <!-- Explain why I choose Ionic Section -->
      <div class="project-section" id="eduSec">
        <h2>Why I chose Ionic</h2>
        <p class="text-explain">
            Ionic is easy to learn, and integrates with other libraries or frameworks, such as Angular, React, or Vue. Because it is built on top of Angular and Apache Cordova. <br> 
            Ionic provides a library of mobile-optimized UI components and tools for building performant apps on the web, iOS, and Android. <br>
            Because I had prior to this no knowledge about framworks this one looked the most appealing to me.
        </p>
      </div>
  
      <!-- Goal of project -->
      <div class="project-section" id="workSec">
        <h2>The goal of this project</h2>
        <p class="text-explain">
            The goal of this assignment was to grasp a basic feeling about programming with hybrid frameworks. <br>
            So that I know how to set up a new app, add some UI stuff and some programming algorthm functions. <br>
            For that reason I had to build a calculator app in one week.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Calculator -->
      <div class="project-section" id="workSec">
        <h2>The calculator</h2>
        <p class="text-explain">
            First I started with going through the documentation. <br>
            After that I started with installing the Ionic CLI with npm:
            <code>npm install -g @ionic/cli</code> <br>
            Because I wanted to use Vue I also installed Vue the ssme way as I installed Ionic. <br>
            From there I created a new Vue project and navigated the working directory to the newly created project folder. <br>
            To ise Ionic with Vue, I needed to add the packages as a dependency to my project, I used the following command: <br>
            <code>npm install @ionic/vue</code> <br>
            From there I opened my project and in the main.js, I imported the necessary modules to configure Vue to use Ionic. <br>
            From threre I looked through the documentation of Ionic to get started. <br>
            Now I had the right structure to create the components to start building the calculator. <br>
            After I was finished, I run my program locally: <br>
            <code>npm run serve</code> <br>
            Because I had one week the design itself was not detailed, I mainly wanted to have it function as a calculator.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="project-section" id="workSec">
        <h2>Difficulties and Solutions</h2>
        <p class="text-explain">
            I had to put add some functionallity to perform the calculations, to do that I had to set up some methodes to handle the user interaction and perform calculations <br>
            The part where I struggled with was to clear the initial 0 when a button is pressed. <br>
            So I asked a classmate to get some more insight in how to tackle this problem. <br>
            So I came up with this solution: <br>
            If the input is equal to 0 and when clicked on the button C the initial should be cleared.
        </p>
